- Add logo of UPEC and First name/ last name 
- in the fourth box : for later when we run regression we can compute `the relative error formula` 
- Everything is in slider 
- Everything should be updated when you change something 
- Add Read data from csv and it will directly show the data in the noise+data 
- Fix a fixed range for  x_min and x_max 
- The exponential will later be a linear equation : log y = ux + log(v)
